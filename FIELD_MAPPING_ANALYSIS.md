# Field Mapping Analysis

## Current Database Schema (Original)
Based on the migration files, the database has these field names:
- `vessel_type` ✅
- `vessel_number` ✅  
- `vessel_condition` ✅
- `delivery_date` ✅

## Current Form Submission Mapping
The form submission is correctly mapping to the original database field names:

### Buy Vessel Form Mapping:
```
Form Field → Database Field
formData.container.type → vessel_type ✅
formData.container.number → vessel_number ✅
formData.container.condition → vessel_condition ✅
formData.date → delivery_date ✅
formData.pick_up_location → pick_up_location ✅
formData.detailed_location → detailed_location ✅
formData.required_specification → required_specifications ✅
formData.budget → budget ✅
formData.additional_services → additional_information ✅
```

### Rent Vessel Form Mapping:
```

formData.container.type → vessel_type ✅
formData.container.number → vessel_number ✅
formData.container.condition → vessel_condition ✅
formData.date → delivery_date ✅
formData.rental_duration → rental_duration ✅
formData.duration_unit → duration_unit (needs to be added to DB)

- `drop_off_location` (TEXT, nullable)
