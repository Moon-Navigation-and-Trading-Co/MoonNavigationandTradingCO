    // Less than Container Load (LCL)
    {
        question: "LCL vs. FCL: Which is Cheaper?",
        answer: "The cost of shipping via Less than Container Load (LCL) or Full Container Load (FCL) depends largely on the size and volume of your cargo. If you are shipping small boxes or palletized goods that occupy only a portion of a container, LCL is typically the more economical choice. Conversely, if your shipment fills most or all of a container, FCL becomes the more cost-effective option. Understanding your shipment requirements is crucial in making an informed decision that aligns with your budget and logistical needs."
    },
    {
        question: "Which is better: LCL or FCL shipping?",
        answer: "Both LCL and FCL are excellent shipping options, but the better choice depends on your specific cargo and requirements of your shipment. LCL is ideal for smaller shipments, efficiently cargo that doesn't fill an entire container, allowing you to share container space and reduce costs. However, as your shipment size increases, opting for FCL is worth considering, even if your cargo doesn't completely fill the container. While the upfront cost may be slightly higher, the benefits of FCL include faster expedited transit times and enhanced security for your goods, making it a worthwhile investment for larger shipments."

    // Less than Container Load (LCL)
    {
        question: "LCL vs. FCL: Which is Cheaper?",
        answer: "The cost of shipping via Less than Container Load (LCL) or Full Container Load (FCL) depends largely on the size and volume of your cargo. If you are shipping small boxes or palletized goods that occupy only a portion of a container, LCL is typically the more economical choice. Conversely, if your shipment fills most or all of a container, FCL becomes the more cost-effective option. Understanding your shipment requirements is crucial in making an informed decision that aligns with your budget and logistical needs."
    },
    {
        question: "Which is better: LCL or FCL shipping?",
        answer: "Both LCL and FCL are excellent shipping options, but the better choice depends on your specific cargo and requirements of your shipment. LCL is ideal for smaller shipments, efficiently cargo that doesn't fill an entire container, allowing you to share container space and reduce costs. However, as your shipment size increases, opting for FCL is worth considering, even if your cargo doesn't completely fill the container. While the upfront cost may be slightly higher, the benefits of FCL include faster expedited transit times and enhanced security for your goods, making it a worthwhile investment for larger shipments."

    // Less than Container Load (LCL)
    {
        question: "LCL vs. FCL: Which is Cheaper?",
        answer: "The cost of shipping via Less than Container Load (LCL) or Full Container Load (FCL) depends largely on the size and volume of your cargo. If you are shipping small boxes or palletized goods that occupy only a portion of a container, LCL is typically the more economical choice. Conversely, if your shipment fills most or all of a container, FCL becomes the more cost-effective option. Understanding your shipment requirements is crucial in making an informed decision that aligns with your budget and logistical needs."
    },
    {
        question: "Which is better: LCL or FCL shipping?",
        answer: "Both LCL and FCL are excellent shipping options, but the better choice depends on your specific cargo and requirements of your shipment. LCL is ideal for smaller shipments, efficiently cargo that doesn't fill an entire container, allowing you to share container space and reduce costs. However, as your shipment size increases, opting for FCL is worth considering, even if your cargo doesn't completely fill the container. While the upfront cost may be slightly higher, the benefits of FCL include faster expedited transit times and enhanced security for your goods, making it a worthwhile investment for larger shipments."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the maximum CBM allowed for LCL shipping?",

Dimensions: The maximum dimensions for a single package in LCL shipping are 249 cm (Width), 340 cm (Height), and 610 cm (Length). Additional Charges: Any cargo receipt exceeding the maximum dimension limits will incur a CFS handling fee of up to MYR 1,000 to be borne by the shipper per handling instance. Please ensure compliance with these guidelines to facilitate smooth shipping operations."
