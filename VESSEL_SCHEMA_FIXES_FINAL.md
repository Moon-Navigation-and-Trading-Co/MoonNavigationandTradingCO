# Vessel Schema Fixes - Final Summary

## âœ… Database Schema Kept Original Field Names
- `vessel_type` (kept as is)
- `vessel_number` (kept as is) 
- `vessel_condition` (kept as is)
- `delivery_date` (kept as is)

## âœ… Forms Updated to Match Database Schema

### 1. Form Submission Logic Fixed
- Updated `submitForm` function to map form fields to correct database field names
- `formData.container.type` â†’ `vessel_type`
- `formData.container.number` â†’ `vessel_number`
- `formData.container.condition` â†’ `vessel_condition`
- `formData.date` â†’ `delivery_date`

### 2. Buy Vessel Form Updates
- Added missing `container.number` field (Number of Vessels)
- Form now properly maps to database schema
- All validation and error handling maintained

### 3. Rent Vessel Form Updates
- Form already had all required fields
- Properly maps to database schema
- Includes all rental-specific fields

### 4. Missing Fields Added to Database
- `drop_off_location` (TEXT, nullable)
- `duration_unit` (TEXT, with constraint)
- `trading_area` (TEXT, nullable)

## ï¿½ï¿½ Files Modified
- `src/app/[locale]/buy-rent-vessels-forms/page.tsx` - Fixed form submission mapping
- `components/buy-vessel-form.tsx` - Added missing vessel number field
- `components/sell-vessel-form.tsx` - Already correct, no changes needed
- `fix_rent_vessel_missing_fields.sql` - Database migration for missing fields

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. **Execute Database Migration**: Run `fix_rent_vessel_missing_fields.sql` on Supabase
2. **Test Forms**: Both buy and rent vessel forms should work correctly
3. **Verify Data**: Check that data is properly inserted with correct field names

## âœ… Issues Resolved
- âœ… Field name mismatches between forms and database
- âœ… Missing vessel number field in buy form
- âœ… Missing fields in rent_vessel table
- âœ… Form submission logic corrected
- âœ… Database schema preserved as requested

The forms now correctly map to the existing database schema with `vessel_type`, `vessel_number`, `vessel_condition`, and `delivery_date` field names.
